## OpenStreetMap (OSM) Data Scraping and Folium Visualization

This repository contains tutorial how to collect (scrap) data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and visualize the data using Folium in Jupyter Notebook (Python).

I collect data of medical facilities (hospital, clinic, doctors, dentist, and pharmacy) in Bali province, Indonesia. The data contains name of the medical facility, type, and coordinates in latitude and longitude. The scraped data is saved in a csv file and then displayed in simple html page. All the code was done in Jupyter Notebook (Python).
